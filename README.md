**Which tools work best for teams versus solo creators?**

Solo creators thrive with Buffer, Later, or Pallyy for their simplicity and free/affordable tiers, while teams needing approval workflows and role-based permissions should consider Planable, Sendible, or Sprout Social. Vista Social bridges both with scalable features that grow from individual to agency use.

**Do these platforms actually improve engagement or just make scheduling easier?**

The best tools do both. Features like optimal posting time recommendations in SocialBee and Metricool can boost engagement by 30-50% by reaching audiences when they're most active. Analytics in Hootsuite and Sprout reveal which content types perform best so you double down on what works.
